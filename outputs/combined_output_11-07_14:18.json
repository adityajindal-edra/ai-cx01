The correct endpoint format is '/app-automate/app/delete/{appID}' where appID should be the app identifier without the 'bs://' prefix. When an app is uploaded, BrowserStack returns both an app_url (like 'bs://c8ddcb5649a8280ca800075bfd8f151115bba6b3') and an app_id (like 'c8ddcb5649a8280ca800075bfd8f151115bba6b3'). The user is incorrectly using the full app_url including the 'bs://' prefix, which is causing the API to return an unexpected response. The correct command should use only the app_id part: 'https://api-cloud.browserstack.com/app-automate/app/delete/fc87f3574272ce23ac413c619bdd6d84322770b0'\"\n}\n```",
