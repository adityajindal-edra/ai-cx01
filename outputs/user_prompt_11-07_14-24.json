The angle brackets cause the shell to interpret the URL as a redirect, and the full bs:// URL is not the correct format for the appID parameter.\",\n  \"reason/chain_of_thought\": \"Looking at the user's curl command and comparing it to the documentation, I can see several issues: 1) The angle brackets `<>` around the URL are incorrect curl syntax and will cause the shell to interpret this as input/output redirection rather than a URL, 2) The user is using the full `bs://fc87f3574272ce23ac413c619bdd6d84322770b0` as the appID, but according to the API documentation, the appID should be just the hash part `fc87f3574272ce23ac413c619bdd6d84322770b0` without the `bs://` prefix, and 3) The backslashes at the end of the first line are unnecessary. The 'long chunk of code' response is likely an error message or HTML error page being returned due to the malformed request syntax.\"\n}\n```",
