Hello,
To delete a previously uploaded app in browserstack, is this the correct command?

```
curl -u "YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" \\
 -X DELETE <https://api-cloud.browserstack.com/app-automate/app/delete/bs://fc87f3574272ce23ac413c619bdd6d84322770b0>

```

Asking because I am receiving one unexpected response ( a long chunk of code).
Thank you
